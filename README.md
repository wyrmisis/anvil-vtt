# Anvil

Anvil is a game-system-agnostic solution to share the composed display of assets (graphical, auditory, or text-based in nature)  between n+1 clients, built with one focus: get out of the way and let you play some tabletop RPGs with your friends.

## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and preact-render-spy
npm run test
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Preact CLI Readme](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md).
